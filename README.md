If you have to create powerbi dashboard then follow this steps:-
If You have data so it's perfect but if you don't have then you can get from google. 
Then you get overview of that data base (what type of data it have for eg. firm name,there expenses,discount they given, there profit and lose.
After that you have to design dashboard acording to you so that it will give attractive look.
Remember When you create a dashboard, it should look good and be understandable to the user, it should not be too complicated.
Give name to every chart or table so that it will easy to recorgnize.
After completed your project save it on dasktop.
